## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the client directory:
```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
node server.js
```

4. The server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

### Deployment to Render
1. Create a Render account and connect your repository
2. For the frontend, create a Static Site and point to the client directory
3. For the backend, create a Web Service and point to the server directory
4. Set the environment variables if needed
5. Deploy!

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /leaderboard` - Retrieve the top scores
- `POST /leaderboard` - Submit a new score
- Request body: `{ name: "Player", score: 1000 }`

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: Frontend framework
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Game rendering
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Game logic
- **Local Storage**: Score persistence

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Web framework
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing
- **Body-parser**: Request body parsing

## Customization

### Adding New Maps
Edit `maps.js` to add new game layouts. The format uses characters to represent:
- `W`: Wall
- `.`: Pellet
- `o`: Power pellet
- `P`: Pac-Man starting position
- `G`: Ghost starting position

### Styling Changes
Modify `index.css` to change the visual appearance. The CSS uses variables for easy color customization:

```css
:root {
  --bg1: #1a1a2e;
  --bg2: #16213e;
  --wall1: #0f3460;
  --pac: #ffd740;
  /* Add your own color variables */
}
```

## Browser Support

This game works on all modern browsers including:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Mobile Optimization

The game is specifically optimized for mobile devices with:
- Touch-friendly controls
- Responsive layout
- Performance-optimized rendering
- Battery-efficient game loop

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Black screen on startup**: Check your browser console for JavaScript errors
2. **Controls not working**: Ensure you're using a touch-enabled device or modern browser
3. **Leaderboard not loading**: Verify the backend server is running

### Debugging
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for errors
3. Verify network requests to the backend are successful
